Wallpapers from [ElementaryOS](https://github.com/elementary/wallpapers) and [Antergos](https://github.com/Antergos/wallpapers) (rip)

Both these Desktop environment have done a great job at collecting great background images. This just bring together the best of them. I "created" this repository to make it easier for me automate my desktop installation, since Antergos is no more.
